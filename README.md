# Object-Tracking
Implement a Kalman filter with a software application that accepts as input the noisy coordinates and produces estimated coordinates as output. For this, using the constant velocity motion model F with constant time intervals 0.1 and Cartesian observation model H. The covariance matrices Q and R of the respective noises are:
